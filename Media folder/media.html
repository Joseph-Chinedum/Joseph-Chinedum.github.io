       <p>In the solemn journey through time toward eternity, a young boy is laden with a crushing weight of guilt. He wandered through the wilderness of shame and anguish; He’s lost and have not a purpose. He sought satisfaction in the vast pleasures of this world, but still has no contempt. It seems there is hole in him that won’t just fill up, an insatiable desire, of which pleasure can’t help.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eventually, fate caught up with him. He was rounded off and charges were layed up against him by a certain accuser/prosecutor. The accuser had with him an overwhelming evidence, that he could not wait for the court hearing to lay it before the judge and the jury. Prior to the D-day, the accuser took it upon himself to castigate publicly, the deeds of the accused. Evidentially, the people have concluded in their heart that the defendant would recieve nothing short of a capital punishment and there was no way around it.

    </p>
    <p>
        On the day of the hearing, the court room was full to the brim. Shortly, the prestigous judge walk into the courtroom. His mere presence sent dead silence across the room; for he was a noble man of utmost caliber. Protocols were deuly observed and the hearing began. The prosecutor tabled his accusations, to which the defendant was defenceless.He was found guilty of all the charges layed against him. The judge adjorn the the court sitting, which will be the day he will give his verdit.

    </p>
    <p>After a long wait, the court day came. The court sat as usual, filled to the exterior. The people, table, chair and door nails were all attentive to hear the judgement from the most supreme judge. He walk in; his presence as usual sent goose bumps across every skin in the room</p>
    <p> After some coments, there was a suden turn of event. The mighty judge stood from his chair and walk out of his cubicle. Evey being in room including the accuser and the defendent were in upmost dismay, as he walk down, sat beside the defendent, at the same spot his attorney was supposed to sit, if he had one. He put his hand around him, comforted him as though he was his attorney and spoke softly to him ”It is finished, case dismished”.
 </p>

    The above depits the saving grace of our lord and savoiur Jesus christ and my personal experience with him. Once i was lost with guilt of shame, reproach and sin; wandering without a purpose, bound for destruction, but his love found me. He counted me as though i didn't do it in the first place. I am forever grateful and pray whosoever is lost will find solace in his warm embrass. This is why i sing this song below...."He came down to my level"

    <p>The search and success in finding my purpose has opened a whole new world to me. A world I have a considerable amount of control over. Admonishingly, it is paramount that everyone born of woman finds the purpose for which there where born. Lack of purpose leaves a vast gully within to which we often try to fill with pleasure amd materialism. Some two thousand five hundred year ago, a king, to which history arguably holds as the wiset man that ever walked the face of this earth, found himself in the search for meaning and purpose. He explored every corner of life, from 
    pleasure to riches to power. </p>
    <p>King Solomon had 700 wives and 300 cumcubines; he was the supreme leader of Isreal; he was immersed in umlimited supply of Gold, to which his era was named the Golden age; He had utmost wisdom, to which kings and queens of the earth journeyed to inquire of him, notably the Queen of Sheba. He is arguebly the richest man that ever lived. Despite all this, that emptiness was still there to which he mark a remarkable comment "that the conclusion of the whole matter is to fear God and do his will". This brings me to this video clip that sings "turn your eyes upon Jesus" </p>

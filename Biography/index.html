This is known as the as the messege of the our, which was promise in malachi 4:5-6, saying, "I will send you another Elija before the great and dreadful day of the lord come adnd he shall turn the heart of the children back to their penticosta father". This messegecame through a vindicated prophet, William Marrion Braham. He was groomed with Gods word, until bible stories were his lullaby. He is still stadefast and continual in this faith.

                <h2>Why he join Altschool</h2>
                <p>Having made up his mind on learning engineering, he was faced with the a hindrance of where and how to acquire this skill why in the University. He needed a plateform that is community based and remotely accessed from any part of the country. Why scrolling through twitter , he came across an advert by the a popular Nigerian, Falz, advertizing the altschool plateform. Having heard from someone of such caliber, he decided to try out the altschool plateform. This turn out to be answer to his long search. He is able to adjust his schedule to be able to accomodate his formal school work and altschool classes and projects. </p>

                <h2>Goals for altschool</h2>
               <p> Having Secured an admission to study front end development, Joseph made his goal clear by putting it in writing. A part of it which descride how he will, by the end of the twelve month, develop a software the choir in his church, which will integrate the songs that have been sung, yet to sing, thier audio and lyrics and as well the lyrics this songs. This is secondary to his wish of appling whatever skill he will acquire at altschool to his practice of medical rehabilitaton. Attaining financial stability is among, but the least of the reasons why I decided to venture into front end development. Worthy to mention, is that is one thing to set goals and another to finish. Joseph have come to realize that motivation won't keep you going in this journey but discipline and consistency. Motivation only gets you started. see you at the end.</p>
